388;0;False;The prediction '0' is rather unsure: On one hand the 5 nearest neighbours have diverse target values (3x value '0', 2x value '1'). And on the other hand the nearest neighbour has another target value ('1') as the prediction.;The features given for predicting the target value are quite near to another observation already known (they even map exactly on the nearest neighborThe features ['Pclass' 'Age' 'SibSp' 'Parch' 'Fare' 'Sex_male'] have the exact same values as this 1 nearest neighbour has. However, the feature 'Sex_male' differs at most ('0.0' vs. '1.0') throughout the inspected  5 nearest neighbours. Since the nearest neighbours have diverse target values, around the features ['Pclass' 'Age' 'SibSp' 'Parch' 'Fare' 'Sex_male'] with values [ 2. 36.  0.  0. 13.  0.] there seems to be intersection of the target values {0, 1}.
643;0;False;The prediction '0' is rather unsure: On one hand the 5 nearest neighbours have diverse target values (3x value '0', 2x value '1'). But on the other hand the nearest neighbour has the same target value too.;The features given for predicting the target value are rather far from any other observations already known. No feature has the exact same values in the range of the 5 nearest neighbours. However, the feature 'Sex_male' differs at most ('0.0' vs. '1.0') throughout the inspected  5 nearest neighbours. Since the nearest neighbours have diverse target values, around the features ['Pclass' 'Age' 'SibSp' 'Parch' 'Fare' 'Sex_male'] with values [ 3.   2.   3.   2.  27.9  0. ] there seems to be intersection of the target values {0, 1}.
